# ☁️ AWS Cloud Journey

This repository documents my personal learning journey into AWS Cloud Engineering. Each week, I focus on building hands-on experience with one or more core AWS services such as EC2, S3, IAM, and more. The goal is to gain practical skills, understand cloud infrastructure concepts, and eventually apply automation and DevOps tools like Terraform and CI/CD pipelines.
